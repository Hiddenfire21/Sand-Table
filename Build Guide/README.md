# Sand Table Build Guide
### Designed by Ravi Dudhagra ([@rdudhagra](https://github.com/rdudhagra))

This is a build guide for those who want to construct a table similar to mine. The end result will be a 3'x3' coffee table, 16" high.

## Prerequisites
While everything for the table itself is included in the BOM, a few tools are required (all should be available at a local makerspace):
- Drill and assorted drill bits (mostly small, but you'll need something around 1" for the power cord hole)
- Screwdriver with metric hex bits
- Pliers/wrench for holding nuts in place
- Hammer for the finishing nails (or a hard, heavy object)
- 3D Printer
- Soldering iron and solder (access to heat-shrink tubing is also nice)
- Saw capable of long, straight cuts, like a table saw/circular saw/large bandsaw
- Miter saw capable of 45 degree miters
- Some clamps (not required but extremely helpful for the glue-ups)
- **Proper safety gear**

## Bill Of Materials
See `sand_table_bom.pdf` or `sand_table_bom.xlsx` for a bill of materials. I put everything I could think of on the list...chances are that you have at least some of the items already, and the worst case is that you'll have a lot of extra parts for your next project!
