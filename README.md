# Sand Table
### An open-source platform for building DIY sand tables (like the Sisyphus or ZenXY)
### Designed by Ravi Dudhagra ([@rdudhagra](https://github.com/rdudhagra))

Inspired by Bruce Shapiro's [Sisyphus Tables](https://sisyphus-industries.com/), I created my own DIY sand table that uses a CoreXY system to create a square-shaped canvas, yet is still fully compatible with Sisyphus Table `.thr` files. 

The table is built out of half-inch plywood and some 1x8 pine boards, glued/nailed together, and painted glossy black. The CoreXY system is built out of OpenBuilds V-Slot rail and 3D-printed parts. Use of Trinamic's TMC2209 stepper drivers means ultra-quiet movement and sensorless-homing, further simplifying the electronics under the hood. The table can be controlled directly from your smartphone thanks to a webserver that runs on an onboard Raspberry Pi. This table makes an extremely fun and rewarding project that will last a lifetime, and should cost less than $750.

See the `Build Guide` folder for instructions on my specific build, or visit the other folders for direct access to the software.
